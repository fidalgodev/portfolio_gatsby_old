A weather app, that gets user location, and fetches the current weather from an API. The user can then click on the location, and check the weather for the next 5 days. It's also possible to search for other locations, and add/remove them from favorites. Since the API only lets you download a hude .json file with all the location available, I made a [small REST API](https://github.com/fidalgodev/cities-ids-api 'REST API Repository') to get the locations, that is being used when the user searches for a location.
